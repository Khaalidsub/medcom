## Project Description :
In case of accidents, first aid is the most important and crucial. The most important part of first aid is that a patient's history should be known to make sure that correct medical treatment is given. In the majority of the cases, the victim's health is compromised by giving him first aid that conflicts with his health history. This system will help us to make sure that patient health history and crucial health particulars are known before giving him first aid.
